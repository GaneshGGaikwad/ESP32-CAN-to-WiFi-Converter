# CAN-to-WiFi-Converter

It connects to CAN device and communicate. We can get the data over WiFi, so we can get easily integrate this with web application or Mobile Apllication.

# Developer View

As we look the CAN communication, we are sometimes restrict to use USB based converters. So we need to keep our systems near to CAN device in the workplace. Sometimes it's not feasible. So heres the solution as my point of view and my approch to solve this.

# Prerequisite
Knowledge of CAN Communication Protocol.

Understanding of UDS protocol.

# Installation
